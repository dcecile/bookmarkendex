![logo][logo] Bookmarkendex
===========================

A search extension that provides quick access to bookmarks,
distributed under the MIT License (see LICENSE for details).


Usage
-----

After installing in Chrome or Chromium...

  1. Activate the omnibar. _CTRL-L_ and _âŒ˜-L_ are keyboard shortcuts
     for doing this.

  2. Type 'b', then press _TAB_ to turn on Bookmarkendex searching.

  3. Type one of your bookmark's names.

  4. Press _ENTER_ to jump to the first result. Or, use the up/down
     arrow keys and then press _ENTER_ to select a different result.

Note that you can skip letters in your search text. So, if you search
for 'dn jo', then 'Denshi Jisho' will be one of the bookmarks found.

If you get too many search results, try adding text from the
bookmark's folder path. Alternatively, you can put a special code in
the bookmark's name, and use that for searching.
